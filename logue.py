I don't remember when I last spoke to someone. There used to be whole village here. But all of them dissapeared. I'm the last one left. (You ask him what his future plans are). My plans? To get out of here before 'THEY' get me. Now that I think of it. That old factory might have some backup spaceships that can get us out of here. Would you mind coming with me to come get it?(You agree to his requests). It's up ahead. By the way, Whats that mark on your hand?(You claim you have no idea how you got it)  """
